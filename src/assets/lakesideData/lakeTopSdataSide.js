        lakeDescription: `Lake Superior is the largest freshwater lake in the world by area (approximately 82,100 km²), stretching along the border of Canada and the United States. Its average depth is about 147 m, and its maximum depth is 406 m. It was formed as a result of the retreat of ice caps in the late Pleistocene. The shores of the lake are diverse: from rocky capes to sandy beaches covered with mixed forests of coniferous and deciduous species (fir, pine, birch). Lake Superior is home to lake trout, whitefish, salmon, and pike perch, which makes it popular among fishermen. The temperature of the surface waters in summer rarely exceeds 10–15 °C, which ensures their crystal clarity. In addition to its natural wealth, Lake Superior plays a key role in natural trade (in particular, the delivery of coal and iron ore), water tourism and the cultural heritage of the local indigenous peoples of the Ogibwa and Anishinaabe. Thousands of tourists come here every year for the picturesque landscapes, unique campsites and the opportunity to observe the northern lights near its northern shore.`
